2,Feelings of aloneness,4,mihy84,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mihy84/feelings_of_aloneness/,2,"Hi, 

21m, Diagnosed ADHD. 

I wasn't sure what to do, or where to talk about this, or have anyone i felt comfortable talking about this to, so here I am.

I've just been having feelings of emptiness and being alone, despite having friends at Uni, and having a few really good IRL and online friends. If I'm not at University or Work or out with friends and just at home I feel like i need to be in voice chat with some combination of friends, otherwise this overwhelming feeling of loneliness comes.  I feel like I constantly push people away. I feel like my whole personality is being mean and joking around to people. I feel bad at times, but I feel like this is my whole personality, this is me.  I want to change this because I always feel bad about it but I don't know how to change it. 

I also went through a rough breakup recently which probably isn't helping.

Sorry if this isn't the place, and for the poor formatting, I'm just not sure what to do.

Thanks",1617389842.0

Mental health never improved, spent the last 90 days trying to jumpstart my life again in a new city, got a couple of jobs that I wasn't able to keep more than a week and here we are now.  

Completely broke, absolutely devastated. Still can't muster the courage to commit a more deadlier suicide attempt like jumping from a cliff or something so here we are going of to the streets again, but this time I have no mother to rescue me anymore.  

I wished I could scream or even cry, but somehow it all still feels unreal to me. But it is finally here, less than 50 bucks on the bank, just enough to ship a couple of stuff to a friend that won't be useful for me living in the streets unless I want to become a fucking target for thugs and thieves.

Just venting for the last time, maybe to try to make my brain realize how truly fucked I am right now.  

Can't say that I didn't tried through. Not that it matters anyway, my reality won't change, doesn't matter if I tried my best or not. It didn't worked. So, maybe a couple of months on the street will give me the last push to get rid of this flesh prison once and for all. There is nothing else in this existence but pain for me.",1617389670.0

Anyway the real answer was yes because I have been misdiagnosed and undiagnosed so many times in the past I do not trust any doctors. I have many years of bad quality of life because a doctor has fobbed me off when there has been an actual infection or condition that could be cured. I have had to persevere and that sucks. Even my Depression which I have suspected for years has had another cause had been proved correct (I had a Testosterone deficiency which nobody bothered to check for).

11,Round 4 of ADHD Diagnosis: How to approach the topic with the psychiatrist,3,mii2xe,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mii2xe/round_4_of_adhd_diagnosis_how_to_approach_the/,2,"As you can see from my previous posts I already had to deal with quite some BS over the last few months, trying to get a diagnosis.

Quick summary: Went to a psychiatrist because I think I have ADHD, after a 15 Min. conversation the psychiatrist diagnosed me with bipolar disorder instead, which I disagree with, so he sent me for a differential diagnosis to a clinical psychologist that diagnosed ADHD after an intense, nearly 3 hour session and clearly stated that they don't see any signs of bipolar disorder.
Went for a follow up appointment with the psychiatrist - who didn't know that I already had the diagnosis letter from the psychologist - and he claimed that though they confirmed signs of ADHD, I still have bipolar disorder and refused to treat me for ADHD. 

So now I made another appointment with a different psychiatrist to get their opinion and hopefully finally some kind of treatment.

I did inform the new psychiatrist that I have a diagnosis from the psychologist that confirmed ADHD, but didn't mention the other psychiatrist when I made the appointment.

Now my question is how to approach the topic at today's appointment.

1) Should I tell them the full story right away?

2) Should I tell them that I have a different diagnosis from a different doctor without specifics regarding which diagnosis or what kind of doctor? 

3) Should I not mention the other psychiatrist and diagnosis at all and just show them the psychologist's diagnosis?

I'm scared that if I tell them that one of their peers (aka another psychiatrist nearby their office) came to a different conclusion they might just confirm it without further thought, since I know a few other doctor's that rend to do that...

I'm kind of leaning towards option 2) because I hope  that they will still come to their own conclusion if I don't tell them whether the other doc was a psychologist or psychiatrist and don't say which diagnosis they came up with, but I'm not sure if that's really a good way to handle it either...

What would you do? 
Is there any other option I didn't think of yet?",1617390367.0
12,I think I might have some mental illnesses but I don‚Äôt know where to start,3,mihw38,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mihw38/i_think_i_might_have_some_mental_illnesses_but_i/,2,"I have been crying a lot lately (almost everyday)and my relationship with the people around me are strained . I‚Äôm suspecting it might be because of me.  I notice after a small fight with my sibling, I would cry and cry on and off for about a few hours and whenever I check on my sibling they always seem fine. I suspect I might be too sensitive. Sometimes I would also cry for one hour about a bad test score.

I don‚Äôt like going out because I feel it drains me of my energy and I need to lie down on bed for a while after going out to recharge. The more time I spend outside, the more time I need to recharge myself basically. 

As an introvert I  don‚Äôt have a lot of friends (or go out with them for that matter). 

In the past I to be a pro active student and was very motivated , but now I have no motivation to work.

Sometimes I realise I would degrade myself and I wonder if it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs something wrong with me inside ?

Could anyone suggest if I‚Äôm okay and if I‚Äôm not which mental illnesses do I have? I also can really go see a therapist to see if I‚Äôm just a little stressed or if I really have some illnesses since my parents think that mental illness is a hoax and I depend financially on them.

13,foothills hospital tortured me,16,mi9syf,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mi9syf/foothills_hospital_tortured_me/,3,"There was a man in unit 21 there sleeping on a yoga mat HE HAD NO BED IN HIS ROOM. People got locked in rooms and sometimes - not always - given a ""urinal"" aka an open plastic jug - and other times went on the floor. ""If you piss on the floor, you live on the floor"" - a ""nurse"" said. I heard someone say to their nurse that they had pooped on the floor only to be told to clean it up themselves. There was another nurse who got put in restraints, I think for supporting me. Another nurse told them to give an injection in my shoulder and not my butt but they didn't listen to him or me when I said the same. I'm afraid of giving their names for fear of them being persecuted. A peace officer tried to kill me. There was a nurse and another peace officer who stood there watching. He had a Mario tatoo on his arm which distracted me, he used this distraction to push me - he had my arms restrained - into the corner, then gripped my left carotid with his right hand and used his left to push down on my trachea, then when I tucked my chin, grabbed his hands and twisted away, he slammed me into the ground and choked me from the top with his knee. I yelled ""You're killing me!"" and he stopped. Then all three bolted out of my room, locked it. I requested to use my phone or the hospital phone to call 911 but the hospital staff called it ""inappropriate usage of the phone"". It occured around March 6, I was traumatised so I don't remember the exact date. A nurse smuggled my phone to me several days later so I could call 911 and I never saw her again afterwards. I tricked the hospital staff later into giving me my phone by claiming I have a girlfriend who'll commit suicide if I don't call and used that time to send distress messages about the murder attempt and more to every email address I know. They confiscated my phone again for ""inappropriate usage"". They earlier confiscated all of my property and put me into isolation room for a month from March 1 to March 25, reversing a court decision from February 26 which was to put me on a CTO and used my attempts to escape and the hunger strike I went on as a result of the human rights violations I was witness and victim to as ""symptoms of psychosis"" to detain me under the Mental Health Act. In unit 22 there was no door to the shower, they had it half covered by a plastic bag but when I was undressing to shower I could clearly see the hallway and thus was visible naked. I tolerated this because I had to shower but later spoke up about it at a meeting when I was not in isolation, Feb.28, and was soon after informed by Dr. Wu that unlike my planned discharge under CTO that Tuesday I would remain in hospital for several weeks. This really scared me, plus I had already had enough with my initial 12 day stay in isolation, the lack of heating, the food shortages, the person who was screaming to let them see their lawyer and was denied the opportunity and food and locked in their room a full day so I sent out distress messages to every email address I knew on March 1 saying I was being detained illegally, would kill myself unless discharged immediately, that there was no privacy in shower, that the food made me want to vomit (I almost did from the oatmeal), and that a federal investigation was needed. I also informed them about the person who was denied the right to speak to his lawyer, and that a person next to me just said he did not want to wake up tomorrow. After this, from what I understand, people called the police and the hospital was in turmoil. A nurse came and told me to hand over my phone. I refused to give it and instead tried to peacefully walk out of my room with all my belongings with intention of leaving hospital. Two security guards restrained me, confiscated all of my belongings, and took me to the isolation room. I spent from March 1 to March 25 in different isolation rooms or ""high ops"", in units 21 and 22. In unit 22 I saw the same man as was screaming for his lawyer, who did not need a walking aid before with a walking aid - I'm not sure what it's called, a thing with wheels that goes in front of you. I hope that I'm just reading too much into that. I was not aggressive for a single moment while I was there, I only used peaceful forms of protest. Dr. McLane and a doctor I have never met wrote these down as symptoms of psychosis and abused the Mental Health Act to issue me renewal certificates and reverse the court decision on releasing me under CTO. I was refused a copy of these certificates for a week after my initial form 1 expired and I suspect that they were not even written before then. I was refused the right to contact anyone, including the police and lawyers, most of the times I requested to do so, and was only allowed phone usage 4 days in that month, including once an hour the one day I made that girlfriend story up. They made sure to not let me call 911 by giving me only the speaking portion of the phone and dialling for me behind a locked window. They kept me in a small locked white room for a month, going so far as to close the blinds - you can't open them without a special key - because I was signalling my distress to people through the window. The room had conditions which can lead to sensory deprivation. They often ignored me when I asked to go to the bathroom so I had to hold it in. They forced injections in the butt on me with absurdly large needles, in a way that was overly painful. On two occasions they gave me an injection in one side of the butt, then immediately in the other. They stopped it after I stole the hospital phone and called the police to report torture. The nurse that did the double injections was the same one that stood there while I was being murdered and she intentionally showed off the needle length to me saying ""that's a long needle"" to intimidate me. I was already on a monthly dose of Abilify as per the CTO decision and even took a dangerously high dose because Dr. McLane said it would get me discharged faster so I did not need further medication. These injections were sometimes so painful that I could not sleep afterwards and on one occasion my leg started spasming uncontrollably. I believe that these injections were torture and together with the murder attempt were made because I was constantly inciting the nurses to go on strike against all these violations by telling them to not be slaves and quit their jobs at the beginning of March. I was targeted for speaking out against abuse and torture. In unit 21, there was a door to the shower but the shower was filthy and was not cleaned for at least a week. I refused to shower because of the filth and because the staff would not give me my shampoo, insisting that I use hospital shampoo instead. After two weeks I could not help agreeing to shower. When I did, they gave me a container with shampoo that was the worst thing I've ever smelled. I have grounds to believe that they mixed something into that shampoo that made it smell like that. When I was transferred to Peter Lougheed Clinic I did not receive some of my belongings back. The hospital claims to have returned everything but they have not returned: an icon of St. Michael, four japanese books, a stylus for writing on tablet, my shampoo and sponge for washing myself, colour pens. They also ""lost"" my Visa credit card as soon as I was first admitted. It's a good thing all my money is on a different credit card. While I was in isolation after March 1, my clothes was never washed, so I had to reuse less dirty clothing to keep as clean as possible. Security were rough with me often and sometimes it would feel like my arms are about to break. They restrained me not because I was aggressive - I never was - but because I was peacefully protesting by ringing the emergency call bell in the bathroom. They would always roughly through me on my bed after these protests, and on several occasions they did so in a dangerous manner that almost resulted in injury.

18,How to provide support for ex-partner with suicidal thoughts?,2,mii9ju,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mii9ju/how_to_provide_support_for_expartner_with/,2,"I found myself in this situation where I am just absolutely lost and it's tormenting me. I am asking for your help, good people of Reddit.

I broke up with my girlfriend 2 month ago, after a 2 year long relationship. Just when I thought that maybe slowly I (and hopefully her too) could start re-building myself, I got some messages from her which implied that she is thinking of taking her own life. Naturally I freaked out, went to see her, talked to her and she could get her to open up a little bit to me about what is going on inside her. 

She has had suicidal thoughts during our relationship too, but, although they worried me, they never seemed to get very serious. Now, however, she found herself in a situation, where everything is falling apart around her, among others, she lost the stability that our relationship brought to her. She is constantly struggling with low self-esteem, not believing that she is capable of taking control over her life, feeling like she is not bringing love and good to the people around her, just misery. She is down down down, not seeing a way to get up from there. She had been researching how to get assisted suicide in Switzerland. The only (non suicidal) solution she feels there is, if we could re-start our relationship in some form. 

I am just definitely not ready for this, not for any kind of relationship, but especially not one which starts out of this kind of desperation from one side. I cannot see in any way how this could turn out good, any better than where we left of 2 months ago. I love her and care a lot about her, I showed this sometimes after our break up too (I know, not wise..) upon which she repeatedly built false hopes that there is still a chance for us.

We met once more since the time I learned about her suicidal thoughts, and it is clear, that she is clinging with all her might to this hope of our relationship. I cannot let her go to be on her own in this situation, but all my presence brings to her life is misery, seeing the person she cannot have for herself. She doesn't feel heard by friends, although as far as I can tell, she does have people around who love her. Maybe it's just the negative view of her self-worth that makes her think people don't care. She has also been seeing a therapist for a year now, but she hasn't shared these thoughts with her yet.  


I know that I am the person who is the least ideal for trying to provide support for her now. But still, I cannot just pull myself out from this and hope that nothing bad will happen, right? I only have to bet on the wrong horse once, to never forgive myself for my entire life. Do you have any experience with similar situations or any thoughts on this at all? Anything would be a lot appreciated

One of which is whom I call the puppetmaster because he tries to attach strings to me with his fingertips. He wears a worn, torn, and dirty suit that is too small for him, is bald, has long ass dirty fingers with dirty under the nails, is paper white, like 8ft tall, has a shark toothy mouth with rotting teeth that gives a very wide grin, and wears really really really nice freshly polished dress shoes and black/plaid diamond tube socks. 

It seems that since I have named him he has becomes less mischievous. I also can't seem to despise it anymore, like I do other things I see. But he is a NoSeeUms, its a broad term describing things I see that have no eyes. I dont mean that they are missing, I mean that they never had any.

There is also a creature that shows me visions of future events, things I should do, or its/others interactions with me from their eyes. I havent technically given it a name I guess but whenever I try to name it I always choose ""???"" So ig thats what I call it now.

There's a TL;DR.",2,mihs70,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mihs70/long_story_that_im_just_gonna_put_out_there_and/,1,"Okay so I have this friend, we've been best friends since we were like, 10. Were now 21, life has taken us in different directions but we're still incredibly close. I moved away in my late teens because of my mother who just kind of dropped it on me that we were packing up and leaving the next day. She's not a great person, but that's not really what I want to get into right now.

After I moved my friend and I, let's call him Chris because it will make it easier to keep on track, fell pretty out of touch with one another. We'd touch base and have a great time but then not speak for months at a time. It sucked, I was upset all the time, I didn't really have any real friends in my new area and I was too upset to ever like, do anything about it. It's been about what, six years now? I'm doing better but not really.

Anyway, Chris and I reconnected again only like, a year or two ago when he got his license. I still don't have mine because my mom can't stand driving with me for again, reasons I don't want to get into. But it made it easier to see each other and hang out, and of course the internet helped once we reconnected and stayed in touch. Things were good, we spoke most if not every day again. Vidya, movies, life stories. Shit was great. We'd stay up late and play drinking games and get shitfaced together all the time.

Everything's great at this point, and I'm in a position, financially, where I can start going and visiting him instead of waiting for him to come and visit me. We start hanging out in person more often, I reconnect with everyone, and start getting introduced to other people from my old area.

One such person is this girl Chris is low-key trying to set me up with, let's go with Skye. Skye is a touch younger than us, but we went to the same school so there's a passing familiarity. Anyway, Chris says to me 'Hey omega, Skye wants to play some Vidya with us. You interested?' and because I like meeting new people, I was obviously in.

We play for a few hours all in a big discord chat, there's a bunch of us, and Chris and the others slowly kind of peel out until it's just Skye and myself left. We get chatting, things are great, were getting along well and Skye mentions she has a partner. Which is fine because at this point I didn't even know what Chris was getting at. Anyway we chat for a while and I eventually excuse myself, things are great.

When I come back later to get on our usual drinking game shenanigans with Chris he's in a great mood and saying like. 'What do you think of Skye? You like her? Think she's cool?' all the usual, and I said 'Yeah to be honest she's the kind of girl I'd love to be with', which isn't a lie. I could *hear* him smiling when he goes 'Yea and you're the kind of guy *she'd* be into.' which made me grin like an idiot too. I mentioned the boyfriend and he basically said 'Dont worry about that, she's going to dump him soon' and we left it at that before getting shitfaced and forgetting the chat.

So, slight tangent. In my entire time living away from Chris, I've been in one relationship, which ended about four years ago. This whole introduction took place like, mid corona or so. Anyway, it gets lonely, and I started showing some pretty big signs of depression and anxiety. Though of course I'm too anxious to go to a doctor so nobody with any professional training has diagnosed it, but I don't think there's a single person out there who would deny my tendencies. I don't like self diagnosis, but I'm also not just making this up for attention or anything. I'm in a rut right now, and for those currently sticking through this word vomit, thanks. Don't come at me, I'm *trying* to seek professional help, but with my mom and her abusiveness and my own inability to convince myself I'm worth taking care of, it isn't easy. Anyway, depressed, anxious, lonely. Me in three words.

So after a good four years my best mate is trying to set me up with this girl who I really like the *idea* of, at this point we haven't officially met though. So one of our other friends invites us all to his birthday party, Skye, Chris and myself included. 

As expected, Skye and I hit it off like nothing. Lots of similar interests, the same sort of beliefs and idealogies, match made in heaven as far as I'm concerned. Though at this point Skye hasn't broken up with her partner, so I was keeping my distance. I'm bad at keeping platonic friendships with people, particularly girls because more often than not the more I get to know someone, the more I like them. I feel that's important to bring up, because I've never really had friendships with girls up to this point. Nowadays it's different, but this was when I was near my lowest.

Anyway we leave on good terms and do all the like, Facebook, Snapchat adding and stuff that you do, but we don't really talk much because I'm not interested in getting in the way of her relationship. And my life is just generally improving at this point. I landed a fantastic job, was interested in an actually single girl who was also kind of interested in me. I was making normal friendships with girls and just generally seeing a lot of self growth. Mental health on the rise, smiling all the time, maintaining relationships better with friends and family and everyone else. It was great.

Then one of my closest friends killed himself. It fucking shattered everyone. Nobody saw it coming, Chris took it the hardest, Skye was broken up about it, and I fucking nosedived. I tried to drink myself to death at every opportunity, suicidal thoughts sprung up again, which quickly gave way to tendencies. I won't go into details because I don't know how that'll fly here but, you know, I was just not okay.

In these times I spent a lot of time with my friends, both giving and receiving support from them all, and in particular Skye and I got to know each other better. When I'd have my episodes she was really good at keeping me calm, we traded phone numbers, we started talking more regularly, even making plans for just the two of us. And this is kind of where I start to make my point.

Chris was shattered, like, a lot more than all of us, and I don't blame him. But he channeled everything into working on himself. Self love was his new way of mourning and the guy flourished like nothing else, meanwhile I was trying to unalive at every corner because I'm about as stable as a rocking chair. I needed that little extra support I wasn't getting from family, and I reached out to Skye and tried to make plans for just the two of us, which she was super excited about. Until the day we were meant to meet up when she cancelled saying essentially 'Chris doesn't think it's a good idea'

Now maybe you're doing what I did. 'Why does it matter what Chris thinks? He wasn't even involved?' and I wish I could say I let it slide, but I didn't. I walked up, cut ties, and stopped talking to everyone again. Now Skye was still with her partner at this point so it's not like I was going to try anything, I just wanted to talk to her because she's very empathetic and grounding, but regardless of my reasons we didn't end up talking for ages. 

Fast forward a while, I was mostly out of touch except the occasional text or call from someone reaching out. I spent 100% of my time in my room doing nothing, I started lagging behind at work, I was fighting with my family constantly, and I broke down. I was literally mid-attempt when my phone rang and Chris was on the other side. He was just checking in and I guess divine timing on his part, he immediately figured out what I was doing and talked me down. We made some plans for a mental health break where I could get away from my mother for a while and just be with friends for more than a night like I normally was. Took time off and everything.

Best weekend of my life, hands down.

Skye was there, and we kind of rekindled that friendship I'd shattered. And I feel it's worth mentioning at some point, I had definitely developed feelings for her that came and went. I denied them, both to myself and to others. Chris asked me a few times how I felt about her and I had to literally say 'I don't feel comfortable talking about her, because I really like her and I don't want to find myself getting too caught up in her', to which he nodded and smiled, he was super supportive and reassuring and kept my spirits up. He was in the beginnings of a relationship and was pretty sympathetic to everything.

Anyway Skye and I spent a lot of time together that weekend, talking about nonsense and going on for ages about dumb things that only we found interesting. At the end of the weekend Chris and I are alone at his place and he's like 'So, Skye. You like her? You in? Think you could be with her?' and I was finally able to honestly and openly say Yes. Which made him beam.

I was really coming around to the idea, and Skye broke up with her partner not too long after, which I didn't even know. But she started reaching out to *me* to talk more, which has been the majority of the last week for me. We'd call and talk for hours, *hours*. Well into the nights. We were sharing music, stories, beliefs, art, everything. Its been amazing. Everyone in my life has noticed how well I've been doing and a lot of people have been pretty adamant that Skye is interested. Probably more than interested.

Chris called to check in today as he does sometimes, asked how I was, why I was happy, what's been different, and I was super excited to tell him it was because of Skye! The girl he was trying for ages to get me with!

And he laughed and went 'Hell yeah man, she's great. Hey what do you think of me and her as a couple?' and I just had to like, stop. And be like

'What?'

And he laughed again. 'Yeah I dunno, we've been hanging out lately and I think I might just get with her.'

Now look, I'm not a jealous person usually. I wouldn't even call this jealousy to be honest. But what I am, is easily hurt. Now I want to say that this isn't cherry picked, this is genuinely how everything happened. I'm not even paraphrasing much. He introduced me to this girl, told me we'd be perfect together, waited for her to be single while I was building up to... Something, I guess. Then swooped in to go 'Lol no'.

I changed the subject, I started talking about other stuff to get my mind off it, and then I had to go because service dropped. By the time I had service again I was done, I was in such a pit I just fell into bed and slept. I got a message from Chris later saying something happened and he'd be busy and unable to talk for a while, and Skye messaged saying she was bored beforehand and I'd offered to call her. Beforehand as in, before I fell asleep. Which was like 5 hours ago, and I haven't heard from her since.

Anyway I don't know what to do, I kind of lost sight of where I was going when I was writing this. I guess I'm just really upset. I don't know why. It doesn't make sense to me. It's not like he *did* ask her out or anything. It's not like he even *will*. Is it wrong that I'm upset? Am I just fucking stupid? I don't know what's going on. This is enourmous. I've been typing for like, half an hour now. I don't even know what I'm trying to say anymore.

Tl;Dr: Best friend introduced me to a girl telling me we'd be essentially perfect for each other, spends ages building me up to be able to get with her, waits for the opportunity to present itself and for me to start building a proper relationship with her before saying he wants to be with her now.

So like, what do I do? Just keep trying to build something between her and I? Forget this ever happened and pretend I'm fine again? Delete this in ten minutes and add it to my growing pile of wasted energy?",1617389064.0

27,I finally realised just how depressed I really am *warning: quite a long read*,2,mih0fj,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mih0fj/i_finally_realised_just_how_depressed_i_really_am/,2,"I‚Äôve been suffering with depression (that I know of) for around 2-3. Nobody in my life really knows of it, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm using this post as a way to express myself and be able to open up to others. 

This last week I was seriously contemplating ending my life, I would picture running away from my house to go to a bridge that I live close to, then jumping off of it. I pictured the aftermath as well, with everyone I know attending my funeral. When I walk back home from school (I‚Äôm still a teenager) I‚Äôm able to see that same bridge quite clearly, and would picture jumping off of it almost everyday. Subconsciously in my head I would think ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the place I‚Äôm going to die.‚Äù But yesterday I realised that this is not the way to go about with my life and am now trying to move on.

I also have ADHD and am quite of a maladaptive daydreamer. So today, this morning, I was caught in one of my daydreams for around 1-2 hours and I pictured myself opening up about my life to someone I know. This actually lead me to finally understand the full extent of my depression properly: 

My family is extremely toxic and are the root cause of my mental health problems. They are emotionally abusive and also physically abused me quite often as a small child. My parents are extremely borderline/ emotionally unstable as well and it often feels like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells with them. In fact, I was genuinely scared of my dad as a child because of how quickly he gets angry and his tendency to hit me. Everytime I cry, my family members will mock me for it so now I have resorted to locking myself up in the bathroom and crying there silently whilst listening to music. I feel like a failure and a disappointment as I‚Äôm barely managing in school because I just seem to lack the proper attention span, and I also feel like my hyperactivity annoys everyone around me. I think it‚Äôs the reason why I never had any proper friends in school until I reached the age of 10. The thing is, my parents still believe that I‚Äôm just ‚Äúbeing lazy‚Äù and ‚Äúnot serious enough‚Äù about my studies even though I‚Äôve told them time and time again that‚Äôs not the case. This is why I‚Äôve never been treated or had any help for ADHD. They tell me I ‚Äúwill never amount to anything in life‚Äù and they always compare me to my brother who naturally has a very high IQ. He now studies medicine at one of the world‚Äôs most top universities... whilst I‚Äôm barely scraping by in maths.

I know someone will tell me that I need to open up to someone but I honestly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready for that. I have a bunch of really close friends who I love to bits but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm actually comfortable enough to open up to anyone. At the moment I‚Äôm just craving a hug really. I think I‚Äôve only been hugged two or three times in my whole life (when I was 12) and they were both extremely awkward/uncomfortable. Back then I didn‚Äôt understand hugging one another but now I do. I‚Äôm also not comfortable enough initiating one so I wish someone can just reach out to me and give me a hug :( I‚Äôve even daydreamed about it.

 I could go on and on about other things such as how my family is suffering from long-term COVID-19 or about my narcissistic grandma who I am forced to share the same bed with. But I don‚Äôt want to make this post too long so I‚Äôm going to end it here.",1617385657.0

29,I'm sick of living in this body,2,migtfz,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/migtfz/im_sick_of_living_in_this_body/,2,"I have food allergies, blood sugar issues, a bit of a food addiction, asthma (that feels like it is worsening over time), and mental health issues that never leave me alone. I don't know if my mental health is worsening or if its just always been like this. Whenever I'm on my meds, I want to be off of them. Whenever I'm off of my meds, I want to be back on them. My medication makes me tired and lack any motivation, but without it I feel so vulnerable and I have panic attacks. I feel like a shell of myself. Most of the time, I feel nothing. 

I can't remember the last time I felt genuine joy. My happiness is fragile, my pain; hurt; and resentment is deafening, and the numbness is comfortable but not satisfying. 

I see things, in a way. I'm a very spiritual person, so I do believe in the Biblical God and demons (please don't give me crap for this, it's truly a part of my identity), so I do believe in demons. I do not know if what I'm seeing/feeling are actually demons or just my really fragile and sick mind projecting things. I see them everywhere. Sometimes I need my girlfriend to walk me out to my car because the darkness makes me freeze up and scared. I feel things in the back seat of my car at night, or running up to my car whenever I stop. I have had some kind of panic attack from them before, but they're not like my normal panic attacks. 

I feel addicted to everything I'm allergic to. I ate donuts for the first time a few weeks back, they were delicious. That could be adding to my recent mental issues. As for my asthma, it has gotten terrible. The normal amount for asthmatic to use their rescue inhaler is something like 3 to 4 times a week, I use mine 8 to 12 times a day. 

I'm so emotionally volatile that I've punched things and damaged my phone. I feel like I'm dying, and I almost wish I would. On the other hand, I believe theres a purpose for me. I want to start my own performance car company, and I'm confident I can do that. But I can barely get out of bed in the mornings...more like afternoons. 

I know this can become normal, but I feel numb and isolated. I'm so angry and so sad. I wonder what the point to existence even is, and I believe God has a plan for me, but damn it I have no idea what that is. I feel like this planet is too small, but the universe is too big. I don't feel like I belong here. I feel like my mind is constantly clawing to get at some other demention where I might belong. I don't know if I want to die, but I sure as hell don't know what the point of living is. One thing I know for sure, I'm sick of living like this.

Earlier this week I was combing through my past experiences and started to recognize some things. I ask how I could cope or be able to move on or get over this.

Her response was that she didn't know how to help me without a strong spiritual connection. She essentially is saying the only option is to give it to ""god"". To me its a huge cop out to do this, to me it's not dealing, it's ignoring.  

She understood my side but basically had no advice to offer other than the couple spiritual books she suggested.

55,Is Social Media Use Affecting Teens' Mental Health?,1,mihbhy,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mihbhy/is_social_media_use_affecting_teens_mental_health/,1," 

We are often worried about our toddlers getting acquainted with the technology and we don‚Äôt want them to get too much attached. Toddlers are at high risk of developing wrong habits and dangerous thoughts in their minds but it is to be noticed that teenagers are at the same risk too. They are also at the developmental age and where we might be able to stop our toddlers from using technology, we can‚Äôt do the same with teenagers. So, what can be done? And why is it necessary to be concerned about that?

At teenage, when our kids ask to hand them smartphones and let them use social media especially when they are over 13, we can‚Äôt say no. This is their age of being up-to-date with the society, to discuss things with their friends, to do what everyone else of their age is doing. If you stop them, they are more likely to do it any way but it will be without your consent and that‚Äôs even more dangerous. So, when you are handing them the smartphone, what should be your concerns and how can you tackle them?

## Teens‚Äô Social Media Use and Mental Health

You can‚Äôt expect your teen to catch anxiety and depression while using social media, do you? Most of the parents don‚Äôt and due to it, they feel that the kids should be left alone with their entertainment and fun. Parents think that if they interfere, it will make their kids go away or feel betrayed. But little do they know that social media has a great impact on the mental health of kids. They are learning a few things from social media that they shouldn‚Äôt. They are becoming depressed and anxious day by day due to the things they face on social media.

Let‚Äôs take a look at the factors on social media that might be playing a strong role in deteriorating the mental health of your teens:

### Cyberbullying

Kids who have faced or are facing cyberbullying are becoming a victim of depression and stress. Where cyberbullying might not be considered a serious issue but it becomes serious when it threatens the life of your teen in multiple ways. Many teens have decided to choose suicide over dealing with such issues.

Cyberbullying is a cause for humiliation and harassment in teens. They feel humiliated when they see that they are exposed to the public by someone, and this continues with name-calling, threatening calls, texts, and whatnot. If your kid is suffering through it, you need to help them.

### Envy

No matter how content and satisfied your kid seems to be, when they are on social media, they are not in that mood anymore. Social media is filled with fantasy-based filters and fake life stories. Kids don‚Äôt know what is fake and what is not. So, they compare their life with those who have shared fantasy-based life on social media. They feel like they don‚Äôt own that glittery life and that their parents have given them nothing. This can easily lead to depression and make them think that it is not the right life for them.

### Sleep Deprivation

Their sleep habits are changing drastically with the use of social media. The more they get into social media, the more they get used to it. If your kid is taking his/her cell phone on the bed, they are probably going to chat, share, comment, and do other multiple things and become sleep deprived. And when you are sleep deprived, you are probably going to face mental health issues that will come to the surface in a while.

### Addiction

If you don‚Äôt know it yet, social media addiction is a real thing and it is just like another substance abuse addiction. As they get addicted to social media, they feel the same rush and excitement as anyone with substance abuse disorder would feel. It is as dangerous as that. So, it is obvious that this addiction is going to make their mental health destroyed sooner or later. They lose their grip on reality and make social media their safe place. They usually don‚Äôt care what is happening around them when they have their smartphone in their hand.

### Communication Issues

With social media, it is very common that you will get communication issues. At first, they might develop good friendships and relationships, but they realize over time that those relationships aren‚Äôt real or worse, they never realize it. While they get used to communicating through texts and chats, they forget how to maintain relationships in real life. Even if they get to meet their online partners in real life, they are seen blank. Communication issues can lead to mental health issues where they can question their confidence and self-esteem.

## What Should Parents Do?

With knowing all this, parents must be concerned about the mental health of their kids. Here are some of the things they can do to make sure it doesn‚Äôt come to that point where their kids are suffering from bad mental health:

* Communicate with them about the danger levels of social media and how it can play with their minds. You need to make sure they know what they are stepping into and how they should treat the difficult things that come their way.
* Monitoring them is the right option at this point. You need to know what they are up to and how they are dealing with things. You should know¬†how to hack a Facebook account¬†of your kid if you need to view their activity there. By monitoring them, you can know their activities on social media and intervene when it is the right time.

[Mobistealth](http://www.mobistealth.com/)¬†is the best monitoring and tracking app that can help you with that. It ensures that you know what your kids are doing and how they are dealing with things. The more you know, the better you can deal with their concerns and take care of their mental health issues.

Knowing what your kids are feeling is the biggest benefit for you and you can make sure their mental health is well taken care of. Follow some effective¬†[tips on parenting](https://www.mobistealth.com/parenting-hacks/tips-on-parenting)¬†and become a good parent to your kids.",1617386988.0

I came to the conclusion that overthinking is the source of all my problems. I also fall prey to perfectionism, analysis paralysis, Information overload and FOMO.

The problem is that these counterproductive thinking patterns prevent me from attempting to overcome them. It‚Äôs Catch-22. There are countless resources on overcoming perfectionism and overthinking, which is overwhelming, so avoid it entirely. 

I can‚Äôt move forward in life because there is too many options in how I can move forward. For example, I neglect my health because I feel lost in the sea of information on diet, exercise and my ailments. And I haven‚Äôt even begun tackling a big financial decision I should have made months ago. 

I question everything. I can‚Äôt be certain of anything. I‚Äôm paralyzed and I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind. I ponder pointless questions like ‚ÄúIs there objective truth?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow can I be sure of anything?‚Äú or ‚ÄúWhy do anything?‚Äù.

My problem is not that I‚Äôm unable to push myself to do things, but that I‚Äôm unable to convince myself that an action is correct. I even discard personal experience e.g. I know that good sleep and going on walks make me feel a lot better, but it‚Äôs not enough for my brain to be convinced that I shall focus on building these habits. 

After my only close friend, who could motivate me to act in spite of my indecisiveness, had left me, I just gave up on attempting to better myself. Even since then, I couldn‚Äôt convince myself to do anything other taking care of hygiene. 

How do I find the basis, the justification for doing anything? How do I become convinced, certain of something? It seems like I cannot prevent doubt from originating and I cannot force myself to believe something.

63,Terrified I'm a narcissist.,1,migb7j,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/migb7j/terrified_im_a_narcissist/,1,"I am absolutely terrified I am a narcissist. Or a sociopath. I'm also very sure that I am deeply hated/disliked by many people around me.  I am extremely terrified that I am a covert narcissist who is just manipulating everyone around me for my own attention seeking needs and validation. 

&#x200B;

I have insanely high integrity. 

I am sometimes very giving to others, personalized gifts that fit people likes and dislikes (One of my friends didn't have a car so I gave him money to put towards one, Another person I knew was insanely good at drawing so I went out and bought him two sketch pads, colored pencils, and charcoal pencils so he could use them. It makes me happy to do stuff like that) 

I get confused sometimes by sarcasm and can't understand when someone is being serious or is joking (Someone saying 'Love that for you' in a flat tone of voice.)  


Sometimes jokes go way over my head (When I was young my Uncle made the joke of ""I' heard Saddam Hussain was a real freak in bed, He likes to strap a potato to his dick before he has sex, because he's a Dicktator, Instead of laughing I got uncomfortable because my uncle said dick and I didn't understand why he was talking about something like that)   


I swear sometimes I'm autistic or something. Making friends isn't necessarily hard for me. But I do have a tendency to isolate myself. I get agitated extremely quickly when I don't understand others.   


When I was young I almost always threw a tantrum when being woken up for school.   


I don't like seeing others in pain or suffering though I have learned to adapt (I used to be terrified of mortal kombat, I can't stand seeing animals in pain, the sound of children screaming and crying kills me, etc)   
I don't really like being the center of attention and sometimes when out with friends at a club or what not I have ended up standing alone watching everyone else wondering why I am just not feeling it.   


I broke down as a child while in school when a teacher at a christian private school told me I couldn't take my toy my mom gave me when I was born with me to heaven. This practically destroyed me.   


I was terrified of Santa, My grandparents had to tell me he wasn't real so I wasn't scared on Christmas Eve.   


I don't understand myself. And up until last year I never really reflected on anything as much as I have now. It's driving me insane. I didn't even honestly know what a sociopath or narcissist was until things were brought up. I always just thought I was normal. 

&#x200B;

I'm also extremely blunt and honest. Sometimes to the point where it's a bit to much for people. And my sense of humor is extremely dry and sometimes insanely dark. Complex jokes go over my head sometimes.   


I've started to say no to people so I don't feel stupid or dumb anymore as well for whatever reason. That was also something my grandmother tried to instill in me with a specific neighbor. She would always ask me to help with things and my grandmother was always telling me to tell her 'No' even though she knew I wanted to always help. It was never for the recognition though. It was always just because I wanted to help. I've always been like that.   


I've read that if you're worried you're a narcissist you're probably not. And I don't really like to lie so I don't really feel like I'm a sociopath, but this is always now an obsessive topic that's been going on three months now. I've lost all interest in everything else outside of this obsessive idea that I am some how a terrible piece of shit person.   


I was put on medication for a little bit for what the doctors said was PTSD but I didn't end up following through with it.   


The one thing I know to be true is that I do feel like I am being lied to sometimes by everyone around me and it bothers me, but the thing is, no one has actually lied to me and just about everything people have told me ends up being true.   


This has lead me to become terrified as it would mean that everything someone I grew attached to very quickly wasn't lying to me and something I'm scared of happening might actually happen.   


I really think I might be autistic, and if I am that's completely ok. I'd actually be happy and ok with it.   


It would also help to solidify the fact that I have really become obsessed with pup play as a kink and an article I came across that turned out was written by a friend goes into detail about how pup play is good for those whom are autistic because it helps to provide them structure and helps people around them understand how to treat them. But I also don't think I am autistic in any way shape or form and that is just another part of me trying to find something wrong with me and using it as a means of obsessive attention seeking.

I don't know what the hell to do anymore. I have thought about getting an emotional support animal though. I do want a dog, But after discussing it with a friend he said not to get one because I wouldn't be able to travel, which traveling isn't really on my list of things to do this year, so I'm left confused again. I think people know something I don't because everything goes over my head so easily.",1617382317.0

As I'm writing this, I'm sure you (reader) will say ""duh you id\*ot..."" ....... but I think I'm addicted to listening to YouTube or anything else I can play in my ear to distract me partially while doing tasks and inevitably simultaneously ruining myself as a person.

So here it is... I haven't been able to find anything that can I relate to in regards to what I'm going through with this. I wake up and immediately need to play some kind of content in my ear to be entertained.... but it's made me a failure as a person. I'm a pretty intelligent girl who has been stunted in life because I can't focus on anything enough to succeed because I get absorbed in content i'm listening to and I'm too distracted to engage in anything fully. I've called it an addiction because I've noticed it's obviously caused issues in my life... but I can't stop. I wake up and need to put headphones in immediately to be entertained... if only for a little bit while I get ready for the day.... but a few videos turns into HOURS... turning into an ""I'll restart my day tomorrow the right way"" situation. I just listen to content ALL DAY. Can anyone relate to this??? I literally feel like the biggest moron but it's my only comfort and no one I speak to can understand or relate in the slightest... it's even potentially (don't let me lie... it IS ) the reason I might mess up college.... kills off my social life.... and makes me feel like a shell of a human. I'm smart enough to analyze what's happening... but can't stop... I'd even rather clean all day than do anything in regards to school and it's close to the point of being too late for me... I'm even in my last semester in school AND I CAN'T STOP EVEN FOR THAT. I'm sinking here... give me some psychoanalysis here please. I'm not crazy, just feel like no one else does this so I'm addicted and weak AF.

This week has been one hell of a ride. I don‚Äôt wanna kms, I just want to bury myself away from the world so I can be alone but it seems like it won‚Äôt happen anytime soon. To start off, my mom is a single mother who raised 5 kids by herself, I have one older brother,2 older sister, then me (middle child), and my younger sister who‚Äôs 6 years old. The age gap between us is pretty big. But that‚Äôs besides the point. We didn‚Äôt grow up in the most stable house hold, we struggle with money a lot. Recently my brother got a DUI and lost his job(he‚Äôs 30), he just bought a brand new bmw but my mom has to pay for his rent and car payment because he doesn‚Äôt have enough money. March 28, I popped my tire on the highway because of a nail, so I had to ask my mom is she can help me because I was 17 and work at a fast food restaurant. I pay my own car payment, gas, and insurance, so I don‚Äôt ask her to pay for anything because I know how much she struggles. She helped my put a brand new tire on 500 dollars. Fast forward to March 30th, My car got totaled because of 2 people decided it was okay to get high and run the red light and hit me head on. My friend was in the car with me and he broke his leg while I walked away with cuts and bruises all over my body. I feel so guilty, even though it wasn‚Äôt my fault he was in MY car and it‚Äôs my responsibility for his safety. Every time I think of the accident I keep replaying when I seen the white truck speeding towards us and crashed into us. My car was almost paid off in 2 years. I‚Äôm so upset. But this is the real kicker, they didn‚Äôt have insurance. So now I‚Äôm not sure if my moms insurance will cover the damage because I‚Äôm not on it. They say I‚Äôm lucky to be alive but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm okay with that. People don‚Äôt understand the problems that come after accidents medical bills, no car, and no money to cover anything. I‚Äôd rather have died with my car. March 31, my birthday, yea my birthday. I always have bad luck around it. I‚Äôm now 18. I hear my mom crying and crying because she‚Äôs so stressed out. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I really wish I would‚Äôve died in my car. I wish they would‚Äôve hit somebody else. And I‚Äôm selfish for wanting that. I also found out my father who beat my mom almost every single night has a new family. I have so much hatred for this World. I‚Äôm barley 18 and still in school. I shouldn‚Äôt be worried  about money, cars, dead beat dad, or how I‚Äôm going to pay for all of this.

In order for me to realize they're hallucinations, I have to ""investigate"" and reach the conclusion that what I heard/felt simply was not possible to be real. 

It started off auditory, and it mostly still is. A few weeks back I would occasionally hear someone call out to me from across a room. It was always either my name, or some greeting. I would turn to see who called me, only to be met with an empty room. 

Next, on top of that, I would start hearing inaudible whispers coming from just behind me, or maybe 2 feet over to my side. Again, I'd turn to check on the noise, only to see that there was nothing that could cause it. There was no one there. 

About 2 weeks ago, it escalated to entire sentences. I would be walking down a hallway and hear the voice of people i know calling out to me, asking me questions, telling me things, etc. But those people, the people whose voice I heard, they weren't there. They were never there. 

Two nights ago, I felt a small animal, say for instance a rat, crawl over my foot. I felt it's individual feet as they stepped across my skin. I jumped back, panicked, and looking down, and there was no animal.

Yesterday morning, I woke up, walked into my kitchen, and I heard someone start knocking on my door. Fast, hard, like they were panicked and it was urgent and they needed the door opened immediately. I run to my room, throw on the quickest outfit I can find, go back to the door, and the knocking was gone. 

Okay, I thought to myself. I took too long to answer so they left. So I go outside and start looking around, because again, it sounded really urgent. I look around outside and don't see anyone. 

I have a Ring doorbell camera, so I check it. At this point, I'm still under the impression that whoever was knocking just left because I didn't answer quick enough. I check the camera, and no one was ever there. 

It's escalating. I can feel it escalating as time goes on. The hallucinations are becoming more in depth. More intertwined with the world around me. 

I don't know what to do. I take medicine, Welbutrin and Lamictal, a mood stabilizer and an antipsychotic, and its worked for months and months and then all of a sudden, I start hallucinating.

So, I thought that it might be okay for me to have a wife. Why should I HAVE to be alone?  Anyway, they thought I was joking. Why?

I am a college senior about to graduate in may and still don‚Äôt have jobs lined up. One of the main reasons that worsens my depression is my relationship with my mom. I have an Asian mom who also wanted me to succeed in school and invests so much in me by paying for tutoring and other things. Things were looking bright back in March because I was busy interviewing for companies, and my mom think I‚Äôm definitely getting a job. Btw I am living with my mom throughout college because she said she couldn‚Äôt afford on campus housing or pay separate rent. Back in March she was treating so well. She would make me food, jokes around with me, prepare interviews with me. Things changed when I failed all of my interviews and I stopped getting interviews. She kept telling me that I have a GPA and won‚Äôt get a job. We barely talked for the past three weeks. She‚Äôs probably disappointed in me because of the fact that she invested so much in me and I couldn‚Äôt even get a job after college.

Same time last year, I was a Junior, I was doing poorly in class and had to deal with stress, so I told her I wanted to hang out with my friends. She asked me why I‚Äôm even friends with them. She said they are lazy and goes to community college. And just a side note, my friends and I would spend every summer celebrating birthday together because all of our birthdays are in august. For our birthday we would exchange gifts and our friends group have five girls, including me, so as you can imagine I buy quite some gifts for them. My mom became mad because I was spending her money to buy them gifts. Every time I came home with bags of gifts in my hand, she would say my friends gifts were cheap and were trash. She also called me fat and ugly, and I remembered I broke down crying myself to sleep. Then the pandemic hit, I was staying home and taking classes online. Things got a little bit better because my grades went up and I got a 3 summer internships. By and large, I felt all she cares about is my grades and if I can get a job. She does not care about my mental health at all. She always told me to snap out of it and said that only weak people have depression.  Ever since last March, my depression really got a hold of me, and I started having suicidal thoughts. 

Another reason why my depression became worse is because I have no friends. I stopped talking to my friends because of my mom, and I don‚Äôt have friends in college either. 

I am so depressed right now and don‚Äôt know what to do. I am on meds but don‚Äôt think they will help if my mom keeps treating me like that. Also I can‚Äôt afford psychologists or therapists because they are so expensive. And every time I asks my mom to find me a therapist, she would just just brushes it off and hope I don‚Äôt mention it again. 

I just need some support at this moment and if someone could provide suggestions as to what I should do, I would really appreciate it!",1617373978.0

I have no friends and I can barely leave the house. I can hardly be around more than two members of my family or I‚Äôll shut down. My anxiety has gotten worse, and my depression following right with it, because I really can‚Äôt live life.

I just want to feel happy again, I want to have friends, maybe even a significant other one day. I can‚Äôt keep icing like this.

87,I don't know myself anymore,6,mi42ts,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mi42ts/i_dont_know_myself_anymore/,4,"I grew up with my mother as a narcissist who stayed home while my dad was hardly there, he was also a functioning alcoholic who didn't remember what went on at night. I was born deaf (Hard of hearing, but there is no way for surgery to fix it so it'll get worse as I age more)

My mom since I was small, always said I was mentally challenged and how she had me tested because I had no social cues (I don't remember being tested for that, more so for my hearing). When a deaf person is isolated from others growing up with hardly any way of communication, they aren't going to have social cues to go by. I grew up thinking there was something wrong with me and why nobody wanted to be around me, I was always told I was trying too hard and I didn't even know how I was doing that. My mom hindered me from growing into my own person by making sure I wasn't successful at all. I remember my mom always doing something wrong sexually with us kids. She recorded me naked when I was a baby but focused the camera on me spreading my legs, slapping myself down there, for my sister she had rashes on her privates, my mom in my 20's when I lived with her would sneak in the bedroom and watch me masterbate at 3am, when I caught her, she'd leave laughing like it's a game to her.

I missed out living in my 20's because of my mom, all I could do is go to work, and come home. If I wanted to date, my mom would spam call me and track me and spam my phone if I turned off the iPhone share my location. 

I'm turning 30 in June and I'm just starting my life and learning how to even do my own taxes after my dad doing it for me, they refused to teach me.

I'm constantly suicidal and not being nice to myself lately after being raped and failed by a judge in late 2019. I don't know myself or what is even real anymore about myself.

88,Should I get help for this or not?,1,mie65w,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mie65w/should_i_get_help_for_this_or_not/,1," I know it's fairly typical for teenagers to get depressed or have unsteady emotions during puberty but I need some advice on if I should seek help and how to go about doing so.

I moved to another state around 4 years ago now and just started high school last fall and I've started to realize that I have problems connecting with people and making friends. This is different in the traditional, introverted teen sense though, because I'm actually fine with talking to people and I make quite a few friends. I'm never lonely at school and have plenty to talk about with teachers and classmates but I've started noticing I have nobody to actually see outside of school. My friend group consists of people that mostly just play video games together outside of school and I like video games dont get me wrong but they arent my favorite thing in the world and they get old sometimes. I cant get myself to invite anyone to activities which gets to the reason I consider needing help.

I have very severe trust issues. Nothing extremely major has happened but I dont trust anybody without knowing them for years. I have this irrational fear that everybody will betray me and/or drop connections with me. Its BS, and I know that but I cant get over it. I've gotten to the point in the last year that I'm scanning rooms quite often. It's not a super paranoid thing I just have suddenly increased my situational awareness by like 1000%. I've also found myself looking at people's hands constantly and their waists to almost look for weapons. But I'm in school and why would somebody have a weapon? You may ask. That's the same question I have. I even saw a giant pocket knife in some kids pocket while doing this, I dont have any fear of them using it on me I just like to know who potential threats are. This distrust in recent years has loosened my connection to my parents more than it should. I love my parents but I dont trust them enough to tell them how I actually am feeling mentally. I have found that I have nobody to vent to about my emotions and it's starting to eat up at me. Its building inside me and I have nobody to talk to about them that I trust. The last person I trusted to tell everything about lived in the old state I was in. But over the years after I moved we grew apart and he ghosted me. I wasn't concerned about this for all of middle school but as I've been maturing I've learned how important it is to have somebody to talk to, and I want that. I just cant get over people potentially betraying me. The other day at school the counselor came in and I learned that she is a trained therapist outside of school and I really think I should go visit her office but I cant trust her enough to do so. I've felt super bad after i lied to my doctor when he asked me a bunch of questions about mental health and I said I was fine. I'm worried if I get therapy I'll do that again which I dont want to do.

Im just longing for a friend that I can trust enough to be myself around. Then again I dont want to funny problems on a friend in case that makes them feel bad too. I dont like people's sympathy either. Basically everyone knows me as this happy, smart kid who likes making others laugh. They have no idea how good I am at hiding my emotions. I truly feel alone in life and its destroying me mentally. Combine that with the stress of school and I've felt terrible for the past few days.

I also want to say I'm not suicidal in anyway and I have no intention of killing or harming myself. I have plenty of goals I want in life, and things I want to see and do. I just worry being alone will lead down that path someday. Should I seek help? If so, than how can I do that when I dont trust anybody enough to talk with them? Anybody have ways to get rid of my trust issues, or at least minimize them to an extent?

TLDR: I have severe trust issues and have nobody that I'm close to in my life. Its destroying me mentally.",1617372017.0

93,"'What's Going On With Granny?' -- My observations on my non-diagnosed mentally troubled grandmother. Seeking: Related experiences from others and help identifying what could be ""going on with Granny"".",1,midair,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/midair/whats_going_on_with_granny_my_observations_on_my/,1,"This will be long. I will try to format it in a way that is easily readable. 

**Family Mental Health Trend:** Mental illness runs deep, very deep, on my grandmother's side of the family. All 3 of her sisters are pathological liars. Telling anybody they meet grand, fantastical stories about themselves that are untrue. Her mother had some sort of psychosis. One of her daughters is also a pathological liar that has gotten her in trouble in court for perjury. My mother is also very troubled. Cousins of hers, nephews, aunts, uncles, have had varying experineces with mental illness, but the amount of them who have been unwillingly committed to an institution is more than 8. And the relatives who have been more than once is about 4. I also have been institutionalized twice. I have been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, borderline personality disorder, OCD, and bouts of situational psychosis.

**My Gramps:** Gramps kept Granny in what my dad likes to call ""The Bubble"", shielding Granny from reality. If Gran didn't approve of something, the idea was nuked. She lived life sheltered from things that triggered her. She got almost literally everything she ever wanted. In a way, she was spoiled. But we're starting to realize that Gramps was just keeping 'The Devil' inside of her at bay.

**Perception of Others:** There was never anything good to say about anyone ever. Even her young children she had toxic perceptions about. Anyone who intimidated her was immediately her *enemy*. Anyone who made decisions that didn't immediately benefit her was seen as a traitor. She would pick out any tiny little thing about somebody to justify her need to *never EVER* see that person again. That included 'disappearing'.

**Disappearing:** When something happened that 'rubbed her the wrong way', she would disappear for 2 weeks. (Actual Examples) Anything from an employee calling off of work to seeing a bumper sticker she disagreed with. She would become silent. Silent and start mumbling. Almost growling. She would then walk away and lock herself in her room for 2 weeks. Always 2 weeks. I went on vacation to see Granny and Gramps with my family when I was about 8. When we were checking out at the store, the cashier told Granny that she had a 'bit of something' on her left cheek. She instantly transformed. She said 'How dare you speak to me that way. I was on the cover of Time Magazine. You will regret ever speaking to me,'. The rest of the time we spent there, she was locked in her room.

**The Lies:** Granny is an unbelievable story teller. She is a published writer. But she creates lies easily and without any reservation - and tells something false to everyone she meets. Her stories were always 'fantastic' in nature, but I really started to question them when I started to hear the same baseline story many times. Every time she would tell a story, she would add something completely new that would place her in the spotlight. First it was changing what people said in her stories. Then it would be changing the outcome of the stories. Then it got to adding things such as adding people to her story that would agree with her, back her up, validate her, or give her money. It once got to the point where she ended a story with ""Everyone clapped"". 

**The Death of Gramps:** Gramps died of liver cirrhosis in 2016. Her bubble had popped. Nobody was there to shield her from reality. Nobody there to validate her and tell her she was right. She moved in with our family. She was okay for a little bit, going through the stages of grief normally. But Gramps's death changed her. Made her much less inhibited by what she said. And then she started saying very, very troubling things.

**The Lies Turn Into Hallucinations:** ""Who was that little boy who was in my bathroom earlier?"" ""What an exciting parade on the street this morning"" ""When are we going back to Paris?"" ""I talked with Nick (her deceased husband) on the phone last night"" 

**The Hallucinations Turn Into Delusions:** ""Why don't you ever feed me?"" ""I know the president is keeping a file on me"" ""I ran for president in the 1960's"" ""You should pick up the newspaper and see what stories they're written about me today"" ""This pen was JFK's"" ""I was given an honorary doctorate at my alma mater for saving the the life of the president of Lever Company"" ""Every doctor says they've never seen somebody so healthy"" ""I knew about Watergate before it happened"" ""Nixon consulted me about what to do about his reelection campaign"" ""Nixon asked me to be his running mate but I couldn't leave my Nick"" and the eventual ""Where is my money?!""

**The Money:** I'll be the first to say it. Gramps made a fucking name for himself in the 60s and 70s. And they quickly accumulated a lot of cash. Everything was handled entirely by my Gramps, though. Suddenly, one day while living with us, she demands to see ""Where all the money is"". We brought in boxes of files of documents of their finances, trusts, investments, etc. All of it was explained to her. This was so unbelievably overwhelming for her that she has never lived a day after that without asking my mother for every single document, UPDATED, to be shown to her. She sits down with some of the less important documents that we leave with her, and she red-pens things over and over and over again. Making nonsense notes on ripped up pieces of paper about numbers she sees. She eventually started demanding to take all of the money out of the bank and give it to her in cash.

**The Fall:** She fell in 2018 and broke her hip. She was given a hip replacement. When she woke up, she was silent. Something was wrong.

**The Drop:** Upon transfer to the rehab care facility, the bed she was being moved to became unlocked and rolled, causing the transfer team to drop her on her hip. She was put through another surgery. Longer, more intensive.

**A New, Terrifying Grandmother:** After the second surgery, Granny lost all memory of life after 1960. She now lives in a Memory Care Facility. What's so terrifying? We thought we'd be able to handle the memory loss, but what we weren't prepared for was to have to literally fight for our lives. Granny on three different occasions after her surgery, tried to kill me, my mother, and my father, in the night, equipped with a knife, and twice just with her bare hands. Her motive? ""Where's my money?""

She was transferred to the Memory Care Facility about a year ago. We get reports every so often that she believes her nurses are her college roommates and every morning she asks what time lecture starts. But around 5pm, every single night, the nurses wait for the 'look in her eyes'. They say she starts growling. And then needs to be restrained physically and sedated.

**Why I'm Here:** I told this story because other than the diagnosis of dementia, no geriatric psychiatrist has been able to address her lifelong history of mental illness leading up to her first hip surgery. I might be looking for something tabboo in the mental health community, which is basically armchair diagnosing of another person. I want to know if anyone can relate to these behaviors that i've described and tell me what she could have been suffering from. My guess is some sort of personality disorder. 

If you've made it this far, I thank you for taking the time to read the psychological history of my Granny.

107,How can I (15) relieve hobby-related anxiety (and feel better during this pandemic)?,1,mic36u,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mic36u/how_can_i_15_relieve_hobbyrelated_anxiety_and/,1,"**TL;DR**: I (15F) got so anxious last May that I lost all interest in all of my hobbies. Ever since then, I've been off and on getting back into them, but every time I get back into them, I‚Äôm scared to lose them again (which always happens). Some of them also can give me anxiety due to controversies and conditioning, which I can never get out of my brain. I always feel better when I have my interests, and they make up a big part of who I am (which I feel like I‚Äôve lost). What can I do?
____________________________________________________________________

I‚Äôm really feeling hopeless. I‚Äôm kind of desperate, because I can‚Äôt keep doing this to myself for the rest of my life. I‚Äôve always struggled with anxiety, but it‚Äôs gotten slightly worse since joining junior high back in 2017. It was starting to get better once I started to get my footing with friend groups and being more involved in life, but due to the pandemic isolating me from all my friends and the outside world, my anxiety has skyrocketed (and possibly developed into depression). I was doing okay at the start (March), even though I felt a little off, but once it hit May, I truly started to panic. All the time stuck inside with nothing to do gave me too much time to think, and I began to worry about every little thing. I had one event in May where I went completely numb for a week, and I was terrified. I felt nauseous, had headaches, could not stop crying, but I felt so empty (even when crying, I could feel tears rolling down but nothing in my chest). It left, and then it came back again a week later. Ever since mid June, I‚Äôve been completely numb, disconnected, and tired. Because of this, I‚Äôve lost all my interest in the things I loved‚Äî the things that kept me going at the beginning of the pandemic and the many years before that

With my hobbies, I‚Äôve been off and on getting back into them. Usually it‚Äôs one at a time, and I start to feel better, but then something comes up and I lose interest in them and start to feel very anxious. Because of this, I have accidentally conditioned myself to become anxious when I‚Äôm getting into my interests. The longest I‚Äôve been into the majority of my hobbies has been a week, and that was a month or so ago. Before May I had no issues, really. I would do anything to go back to those times. I know I said I would do anything to fast forward during those times, but my god I was wrong. Now I‚Äôm terrified of the future, unhappy with the current, and longing for a past I cannot get back (and also sometimes worry about‚Ä¶ ughhh).

Also, and this is what‚Äôs probably holding me back the most, and I‚Äôm scared to say this because it sounds like such a teen girl issue, but some of the music artists that I love(d) and adore(d) have been drug through the dirt when it comes to controversies. Most of them aren‚Äôt too serious, but I‚Äôm often worried they‚Äôll turn into something like that. The worst ones are just based off rumors, which I don‚Äôt want to believe but it bothers me sometimes. Though I obviously don‚Äôt know them personally, a part of me felt connected to some of them, especially the ones who also struggle with anxiety or have a similar thinking. I had a general respect and looked up to them, and I‚Äôm afraid that they‚Äôre nothing like they seem. This is what hits me the most, my anxiety has always been triggered by people ending up being nothing like they seemed. I‚Äôve had some experience with this in the past, and even now

Now that I‚Äôve lost a large interest in my hobbies, I feel like I‚Äôve lost a big part of myself. I was always proud that I knew who I was, and even though deep down I still want to be that kind of person, I don‚Äôt feel the same connection to that or myself as I did before. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôve just grown up, and that I might even be nothing like I thought I was. I guess for context, I am somewhat on the spectrum of the stereotypical ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a phase, mom‚Äù kind of person. I wear all black, love alternative music, tend to have similar views found in the scene, and feel no need to change myself to fit in with the majority (no, I‚Äôm not like the Im Not LiKe ThE OtHer GiRls kind of person). Ever since late 2016-ish (when I started to go in that direction), I‚Äôve felt a strong desire to become this alt, tough, yet nice woman, and I miss that desire. I've never felt so safe, even though these past few years have been rough anxiety-wise. Not feeling connected to myself (or anyone around me, which is worse) gives me so much anxiety  

I‚Äôm sitting here writing this feeling like I‚Äôm going to vomit. I‚Äôm tired, have a headache (possibly unrelated to anxiety, thanks wisdom teeth), and have lost interest in my hobbies and life in general. I feel like crying, but I‚Äôm too tired to cry. Nothing even happened really, I just got reminded that I‚Äôm probably going to get disinterested in my hobbies again, and then saw a controversy that I already knew about. I'm sorry if I sound dramatic, but I just thought I‚Äôd be better by now. I always thought that some event (whether it‚Äôs the start of summer, my birthday, my favorite season (fall), favorite holiday (Halloween), an end to something that‚Äôs been bugging me for 4 years(...), or starting to see family again) would help me get back up on my feet. None of it has worked, and I just get worse every time it passes. Now it‚Äôs spring break, and I feel like I‚Äôm going to have too much time to worry about this again. I'm worried that the end of the pandemic won‚Äôt even help. I‚Äôm so lost, if anyone could give me some advice that would be very appreciated

110,Is it normal for a hospital to discharge an actively suicidal person?,0,mibvu3,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mibvu3/is_it_normal_for_a_hospital_to_discharge_an/,1,"Hi, sorry that I‚Äôm posting this from a throwaway account, I just really feel embarrassed and scared about asking this question publicly.
What is the reasoning behind not admitting/discharging an actively suicidal person from the hospital besides room availability?
I ask this because a bit over a year ago, I felt like I had to beg and plead for help just to get admitted into my local inpatient center. I had gone to the hospital three times across the span of about a month, and only on the last visit did they reluctantly admit me (while telling me the whole time I was filling out the paperwork that they thought it was a bad choice and that I wouldn‚Äôt benefit from it. The whole thing felt guilt-trippy). Ultimately, I feel that I didn‚Äôt benefit from it because for my entire stay the staff‚Äôs only concern was opening my room back up and getting me out, not offering any referrals to outpatient services or supports, nor a treatment plan. At the time I was discharged, I was still in crisis, and in fact worse than when I was admitted. Needless to say, after discharge, I ended back up in the hospital twice in the next two weeks after the stay. Is my local center just shitty, or are all inpatient services like this? I do understand that the point of inpatient is to get the patient discharged as soon as possible, but only after the person is out of crisis along with referrals to outpatient services and a treatment plan, but none of these happened for me. I guess I am just confused about what the purpose is behind discharging an actively suicidal patient, or even the purpose behind not admitting them at all and not giving any guidance for ‚Äúnext steps‚Äù. I just don‚Äôt see how this helps the patient or the hospital, besides the purpose of opening up a room. It doesn‚Äôt feel right. Even to this day, I frequently find myself in times of crisis and only end up h*rming myself again because I feel there is nowhere to reach out to. It is a constant pattern that is agonizing and it feels there is no way out of it besides d*ing.

TL;DR: I had multiple episodes where I was in crisis, was only admitted to inpatient once out of 3 hospital visits, was discharged when I was still in crisis and had actually gotten worse, and was never given referrals to outpatient services nor a treatment plan.

It just doesn‚Äôt feel normal, has anyone else had a similar experience? Is this a common thing for mental health centers?

Info that might be relevant:
- I have been diagnosed with MDD, GAD, and PTSD by a psychiatrist at least a year prior to the hospital stays.
- I do not have a personality disorder (or, at least never diagnosed)
- I do not have a criminal record
- I do not suffer from any type of addiction
- I do not have any developmental disorders
- at the time of the hospital visits, I was seeing a psychiatrist once every three months and an LCSW technically once every other week, but she had been on some type of vacation or leave for the month that I had been at the hospital 3x

Throughout my life I‚Äôve been horribly depressed and unstable, especially during my early teen years. I almost never went to school from middle into high school, and eventually dropped out. My mental health actually got a lot better after I dropped out, I started focusing on getting my GED done so I could go to college a year early and things were good. Then of course the pandemic hit a month later. It was annoying at first, but I didn‚Äôt have any friends or anything so it‚Äôs not like it was a huge deal. I didn‚Äôt go out much either, even though I wanted to but hey when you don‚Äôt have friends to go anywhere with it‚Äôs not really worth it. Anyway, I got my GED done and signed up for classes at community college and I‚Äôm currently in my second semester. Things were pretty decent from when I dropped out to say the least. However as of recent, maybe in the last month or so, I‚Äôve been on a steady decline in my mental health and now it‚Äôs rapidly declining. Complicated trauma is coming back full force and my OCD is at the worst it‚Äôs ever been, and I‚Äôve developed what seems like body dysmorphia as a result of the trauma. It was consistent trauma for the first 12 years of my life and then some and it‚Äôs pretty much all gone unprocessed until now. It‚Äôs severely warped my perception of myself. My brain decided that it wants to go through all the pain again and make me feel like shit, it throws me back into the past and I just feel awful. I‚Äôve been so exhausted, barely any motivation, exercising less, eating less, neglecting homework assignments, sleeping more, crying every day, it‚Äôs just been awful. And I was doing so good before. I was actually working out, eating right, getting my homework done on time and even early sometimes, sleeping okay, and I was decently happy. Everything has taken a turn for the worst now and I don‚Äôt have anyone to lean on for support or even just talk to. I pretty much lost all of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù when I dropped out of school, I kept one and we talk now and then but nothing serious, and if I did he wouldn‚Äôt have much to say honestly. I‚Äôd like to get into therapy again, and for the right reasons this time, but I don‚Äôt want to have to bring that up to my parents. I don‚Äôt want to tell anyone about this honestly. I just wish I could move on but I‚Äôm stuck in this depression that seems like it came out of nowhere. Sometimes I even think about ending it all because the thoughts and feelings get to be too much for me. I just want to feel better but it seems like no matter what I do I‚Äôm gonna have to involve someone else and I just want to get better on my own but I can‚Äôt. I need someone, anyone, a friend, professional, whoever just someone to help me through this. I‚Äôm so lonely and miserable and I just want to get back to a happier place.

I am scared of changing for a reason I am not aware of and having nothing to circumvent it. When looking back on the past, I feel like I was better at all my skills. I constantly feel like I‚Äôm getting worse and worse for no reason. I reflect on the most normal things and consult if I did it correctly. I try to look back and see what I did good and try to repeat it. Looks, humor, intelligence, imagination, height, kindness, personality, the ability to talk, the ability to write, the ability to read, even the ability to push away these thoughts. I have started to question all of these things. 

Then I start to jinx myself. My mind finds what I'm afraid of becoming and it convinces me that I am exactly that. Do you know that voice that works against you? It's the voice that tells you to stab yourself when you're holding a knife. That's the same voice that's causing me to actually change. Remember the saying ""fake it 'til you make it""? Well that can work against you. I start actually acting like who or what I've convinced myself I am. It's almost as if I've been reminded I'm breathing, and I can no longer automatically do it. I feel confident about certain skills, but my brain tells me ""How unfortunate it would be to lose it?"" Then I start to lose it. It's these unfortunate scenarios that I convince myself I am in. If it exists, or if I'm afraid of it, I will think about a bad trait and adopt it. 

A while ago I convinced myself I convinced myself I woke up with a speech impediment I developed overnight. After that I thought I was reverting in mental age. I acted accordingly to those scenarios (talking weird, acting immature) because I convinced myself something is actually happening to me. Eventually I regain confidence but begin to question it again.

On a side note, the voice I mentioned previously is extremely intrusive. Whenever I see, read, or think anything, it tries to come up with the worst possible thing it could say. I've given it a British accent and named it Walter to make it less threatening, but it barely works.

I've become so paranoid of changing I avoid minuscule choices in fear that it will lead me down a slope of change. This includes, but is not limited to, sleeping on the other side of my bed, unloading the dishwasher by starting with the bottom row first, and plugging in cords in a different order.

It may seem easy just to tell me to dismiss these fears and disillusions, but the voice has identified flaws I had in the past that I changed. Now I am not sure what is an actual flaw. I cannot divide between real concerns and red herrings. I am also scared to take advice from anyone that will try to make me cope with obvious flaws. I am a fixer, not a coper. I fix my flaws and don't cope with them by pretending they don't exist. Even if I'm already delusional, I am not going to delude myself that my flaws should be accepted nor should have work put to ignore them.

126,I had an awakening recently...,11,mhufu4,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mhufu4/i_had_an_awakening_recently/,3,"Ok, I first want to start out by saying how are you?? Please if you read this, please comment and tell me how you are. Like I'm not just saying this because it ""seems nice"", please tell me how you're doing!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3

Second, it has been just about a year since the climax in my life so far. (I'm 15f). April 13th 2020 was the very last day that I attempted suicide. I was later in the hospital from April 16th-23rd of 2020. Ever since then, I have been on medication. It hasn't always been easy, I still felt the emptiness in my heart of feeling worthless, and it took a long while for me to be content with being alive. I just wanted to tell you guys, you are so strong, keep fighting.

I know for me personally, I would get sick of (and still kind of cringe at) all these 'therapist quotes' and all these 'inspirational' messages. It just made me feel so small and helpless. Like people were saying these things out of pity and they didn't know how it really was.

But when I say you are strong, I mean it. I have been there, I know how hard it is to keep pushing through your lack of will to live, I know how hard it is to stay alive when you ache and long to not exist. The fact that you are still alive and reading this shows me that you are strong, you are a fighter. And I 1000% don't mean that in the stupid, cringey, pitiful, cliche way... You ARE strong.

Ok, third, my awakening... So I was out with my dad at the beach. There was this father with his young daughter, they were headed towards the pier. It was so beautiful to see his love for his little girl. My heart melted.

I first saw them when my dad was busy reading a sign about who the pavillion was established by/who they built it in honor of. I saw the father and the girl get out of the car, the dad was putting some change in the parking meter. His daughter was full of energy and wanted to run around. I could see the worry on the man's face as he was trying to keep an eye on his little monkey and also manage to put the change in the parking meter.

Later me and my dad were walking towards the pier when I noticed the little girl run ahead of us. I recognized her from before and turned around making sure the father was close by and that she hadn't run off. He is just walking a couple of feet behind us, smiling at his daughter. She pauses and waits for him to catch up. Those lives, they are beautiful.

Same night, out at the beach. I noticed a woman sitting on a bench. She was beautiful. She was wearing a lovely dress and her hair was really pretty. Her life, it is beautiful.

Another day, I was in the car with my mom. I looked out the window as we were driving. There was a man on a moped. His hair blowing in the wind, the smile on his face. His life, is beautiful.

I guess my ""awakening"", is just the realization that life is so beautiful. Everyone is so extraordinary. Everyone has a story to tell, everyone has some element of pain in their lives that they are holding back. Everyone has at least one person who loves them. Everyone's life is beautiful and I almost teared up when writing this. I sometimes catch myself wondering about these strangers. Where are they now? What are they doing? *How* are they doing? I wish I could go back and tell all of them how beautiful they are, and how special they are, and how much they brightened up my day.

There really is nothing quite like people. Everyone is so vastly different. We all have different desires, different dreams, different likes and dislikes, different taste in music, clothing, art, food, we all have something unique about us that others love and are envious of. We all have something that makes us special to the world; one of a kind.

I sincerely mean this... For the father and the daughter, it was the love they had for each other, for the woman on the bench, it was her beauty, for the man on the moped, it was his free spirit and smile.

Even if it seems like no one in your life cares, trust me, there are people. Even if they're complete strangers like me. A random 15 year old girl, noticing life, and appreciating it.

Thank you so much if you read, I really just wanted to share my 'awakening' with you guys and let you know that you ARE worth being alive. Your life is beautiful, and no matter how many times you doubt that, it will always be true. I challenge you guys, whenever you're out and about, take a look around. Find some strangers, think about one quality they have that makes them and their life here beautiful (and I know this might be a stretch, but maybe even take the time to tell them!).

At 16 I was doing an impersonation of a Jordon Belford from wolf of wall street. I was acting like I was sniffing in cocaine and I remember I had immense pain in my nostril my heart raced, I tightened up and then a small thing shot up to my head and then I had head pain. I then went into a dreamlike state for 10 minutes and heard voices then nothing, then a voice kept saying wake up you need to wake up and I did. Then I stood up, got dizzy and fell down. I cant remember anything before the event, my parents, my brother, no one seems familiar. I have had trouble breathing since and swallowing and it hurts to breathe . I have to tell my eyes to look at a paper and my face feels paralyzed to where I cant smile.

After that I stopped sleeping and lost it. I was so obsessed with this event I knew I needed to go to the doctor. I said to myself I don't want to tell my dad we don't talk about non guy things and my mom would get made at me if she found out I was watching the wolf of wall street. I told no one. I got very obsessed about it and depressed. I managed to obsess about it until I was 18 when my brother attempted suicide I lost it. My thoughts went from no thoughts to extremely fast and then I couldn't sleep or eat or do anything I went up north and was over the top happy then came back down after things fell apart and wanted to commit suicide. I was then put on antidepressants. I then had the racing thoughts come back on the antidepressants and all the thoughts I had came back about my brothers suicide and every time It comes up I say fuck It ill work because that's how my mom deals with stress I don't want to play video games anymore for stress relief. So I throw myself into work for stress relief. I have no friends and then I wanted to die so I said fuck it I cant do it anymore. It all became too much the sleeplessness from the racing thoughts for 5 years and all of it and I took a handful of prozac+ibuprofen+something else and overdosed.

Physical doctors- Alright physically you need to physiologist

Physiologist- You have OCD, if you have trouble sleeping see physical doctor to get sleep meds

Other Physical doctor- Your bipolar you need to see a psychologist to get sleep meds

Psychologist- more antidepressants plus sleep meds

I still feel out of wak

I didn't want to let my parents down that I'm not smiling so I went on benders to make them happy

I cant do this shit. I lost my job, my friends, and school because of this life.

I cant take it anymore. I don't know who to see all I know is my thoughts keep racing so fast I cant do school or work lord help me.

Sometimes when you're in a spiral its easy to drown out all the positive things around you and to let yourself fall deeper into the pit of self loathing and despair.

""They're just saying that to make me feel better.""
""I bet they wish they didn't have to deal with me like this.""
""People only tolerate me for a short period of time.""
""I'm only interesting until you get to know me. And then you find out I'm not good enough.""

These are just some personal example of thoughts I've had, and honestly some of them might be true. What's truly important though, is learning from what you've done, and changing what you do in the future.
Even the people closest to you, or the people you look to for inspiration have made mistakes. No one is perfect, and we are all growing, learning, and living people. Don't beat yourself up because you don't fit the perfect image of yourself in your own mind.

Recognize your own self. Set out to do small things for yourself every day. Do things that truly bring you joy despite what others will think. Believe in yourself again because we all have truly limitless potential. Be proud of yourself again. Research your thoughts, gain an understanding of what is making you feel the way you feel. Sometimes power in your mental health comes from knowledge.

Im not a doctor, im not studying this stuff, but im just simply offering advice thats helped me improve on my own. I still believe everyone should find a therapist to help them with their traumas, I just haven't found one for myself yet.

Her self-neglect, poor diet, and excessive smoking resulted in most of her teeth rotting away. She smelt very unpleasant of urine - and sometimes - excrement. Due to the extent of her illness, she was often sectioned in a psychiatric unit so my dad became the person with sole custody over me. 

I have awful memories from my childhood and teenage years, others my age would bully me for how my mum appeared and how she behaved. Sometimes she turned up unannounced at my school during lunch. Even though she was in her late forties, she was drunk, smoking a cigarette, wearing urine soaked denim hot pants, high heels, and a pink blazer. It's sad really - she was a model when she was younger, but now she looks like a crack addict, and somewhere in her head she was living her younger years.  I don't at all blame her. I love her. I experienced a lot of social alienation, abuse and bullying as a result. Despite all the social alienation and bullying I experienced, she is still very important to me. 

However, recently I was accepted into a prestigious medical school near to where I used to grow up in the UK. In an otherwise affluent area, there were hidden pockets of deprived social housing - and that's where my family lived.  Everyone who is going to the uni nearby admires the beauty of the local community, the architecture and the local culture. However, I feel conflicted in my head. The streets I walked down last week were the same streets I walked down alone to get home from school. The beautiful park nearby is where teenagers threw pieces of rubbish at me and my mum when we went for a walk. 

I felt overwhelmed with sadness and anxiety when I revisited the place where I grew up. My heart was beating very fast, my head was spinning, and when I was walking towards such a beautiful university campus I became distracted by memories of the past. 

The happiness and excitement of being accepted into medical school has been cancelled out by feelings of anxiety and sadness of past events.  I need some advice - how do I make these feelings stop? I don't want to be robbed of more years suffering when I should be happy",1617352439.0

I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed (I‚Äôve never even seen a therapist) but I‚Äôm like 99.9% certain that‚Äôs what‚Äôs been fucking me up for the last few months. I‚Äôve obsessed over a number of thoughts in that period. The first being fear of non existence after death, the second being we may have no free will, the third being what if the universe is a simulation, and the fourth being fear of existing forever after death and just general solipsism.

For some reason, my obsessions sort of did a 180 as you can tell,  now instead of being scared of not existing after death, I‚Äôm scared of being around after death. Specifically, the idea that maybe I‚Äôll wander the universe after death completely alone and without senses in pure blackness. Forever. I can‚Äôt stand the thought of that in particular, and while other iterations of the afterlife scare me (hell) that one fucks me up the worst.

Now I‚Äôve pretty much gone down a rabbit hole of trying to figure out what happens after death and if specifically, my worst fear would happen. And obviously I can‚Äôt find a clear answer as there‚Äôs evidence for everything. I was disappointed to find that there even were semi-plausible scientific theories that could support the idea of life after death, like orch-or theory. And even though I realize there‚Äôs no evidence that the theory is true or that if it was, it could support the idea of life after death, or even what life after death according to the theory looks like, that damn theory scares the shit outta me. I‚Äôve researched it obsessively, along with other theories, and it‚Äôs wrecking me.

I hate the uncertainty, the possibility that one of my worst fears could be true, and I really could be a disembodied consciousness alone in a void forever. I thought about reaching out to some other subreddits, but looking at some of the post responses made it pretty clear that they would just suggest that I ruminate more, research more, and I know that‚Äôs the problem. From what I‚Äôve seen about existential ocd, it‚Äôs that the problem is your attempts at researching and finding solutions to problems that can‚Äôt really be answered with certainty. And because of that, I know my attempts at finding answers will be all in vain, and I‚Äôll just keep coming to the same conclusion that I have no idea what happens after death, but I fell like I have to keep searching. Like there‚Äôs an answer out there somewhere, and it‚Äôs my job to find it. I‚Äôve even managed to convince myself at times that the answer has been found out and it‚Äôs getting kept hidden because it‚Äôs too horrible or something.

147,What can cause these kinds of mood swings?,1,mi84xl,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mi84xl/what_can_cause_these_kinds_of_mood_swings/,2,"So basically for a while now I've been having some really concerning mood swings. I go from being so depressed I can hardly move to this feeling of almost euphoria and/or agitation and restlessness within the course of a day sometimes. A really accurate example of this was this Wednesday. In the morning, I was having extreme s////dal ideation and just feeling so low, but then in the afternoon for seemingly no reason that changed and I got this sudden feeling of euphoria. I felt so on top of the world but I also felt restless, like I couldn't sit still. I started to do something really stupid and impulsive, but luckily I came down from that before I could actually do any harm. After I came down from that, I felt so low again and it's like I'd never felt that fleeting high. This is just one example of it, but I've noticed this has been happening a lot recently. Some days, I just go through the whole day feeling really depressed, but other days, I experience the intense mood swings I just described, and it's really exhausting.

I have no idea what could cause this because I'm not on any medication and I don't have any underlying physical conditions. The only thing besides those things that I know can cause mood swings is Bipolar, but I really don't think that that's is what this is because I know Bipolar causes more prolonged phases of depression/mania and my ""moods"" only last a few hours to at the most a few days.

Aside from whatever this is, I'm Autistic and have Generalized Anxiety, and likely PTSD (I have qualifying trauma and all the major symptoms, but I'm too scared to get formally diagnosed.) Could these mood swings be a symptom of one of these disorders? If not, could some people send possible reasons for these mood swings my way? I will NOT take it as a diagnosis of any kind, but more so as a jumping board so that I can research and point myself in the direction of proper care.",1617349479.0

I‚Äôm hoping people can help or understand my thoughts and feelings.

Had a psychotic episode a year ago. Influenced by narcissistic abuse in a new relationship (didnt know this was even a thing.) since coming back to earth, im depressed, confused about who i am, constantly stressed/anxious, lonely, stuck in my own head and stilll in a relationship i cant decide is love or a trauma bond. 

I despise myself often and wish i was better or someone else. 
im overwhelmed with all the self improvements i need to make, after now becoming aware of all my insecurities, bad habits, avoidant tendencies and fake egotistic personas i displayed throughout my obnoxious life. 

iv always had low self esteem, i make no eye contact when i speak to people. imposters syndrome is very apparent.  

Iv maybe even realised my own narcissism too - im self obsessed. I love attention but i pretend i dont notice it, and care only about what others think. without others admiration/interest i struggle to feel excitement. 
I want to impress everyone with my talents, looks, possessions and personality whilst simultaneously seeming like i dont give a fuck. 


I‚Äôm stressing myself about EVERYTHING, my thoughts are racing and im desperate to be calm, live in my body and be like an animal, free, natural and in the moment. accept myself and this life. 
I want relief so badly.

Im worried now that this constant stress and overthinking is draining the life from me. 
im exhausted a lot of the time. iv had so many minor but annoying health problems lately - constipation, gingivitis, sore throat, muscle tightness, coughing, headaches etc.

please someone give any advice to how i break away from this. i feel im stuck in my old life and mind. i want to get away, but im bound by: 
guilt for worrying my parents, 
lack of funds, 
fear of ending my relationship, 
fear of choosing to fuck up my life more and make myself vunarable. 

i kind of want to live on the streets for some reason. i want to be on my own, quit my pointless job and put life on pause and separate from everything. 
is this going to help or worsen my situation? j want to exercise, meditate, and help myself but its been a year almost and the patterns suggest iv made no progress, my emotions are unstable and my lifestyle is toxic. I have no discipline and im weak deep down.

i am desperate and so anything in response to this you can offer is deeply appreciated.

Please forgive me for my imperfect english.

My quarantine, for almost a year now, has been online classes from college (they have been really lackluster, not that much content and nothing that seem to be very useful) and working as an intern for an Urban Agriculture company, which I don't really like to do either. So when I'm done with my obligatory activities, I'm left with no desire to do much.  I usually just lay down in bed for a while and have to almost force myself to do very basic stuff that most people would easily go after, such as watching a movie or playing a game.

That has been especially affecting my life because I want to be an Illustrator, and I used to study and practice as much as I could so I could get better. The thing is, that takes a lot of will, and I seem to have almost none.

164,"What is Happening (Rage, Anxiety, ADHD)",2,mi2iir,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mi2iir/what_is_happening_rage_anxiety_adhd/,2," I have always had symptoms of being neurodiverse that were overlooked. I have cross dominance, I have INTJ personality type (as a female), issues with comprehension, lack of recognizing social cues, and disassociation. 

 The one common thing I have had for my 25 years that has impacted my life significantly is what seems to be ""uncontrollable"" rage. The older I get the more I can feel it coming on but it is like one thing sets me off and I react in a way that is not warranted and my behavior is outright abusive towards my loved ones. 

 Everything is always the same; maybe it is low intelligence, maybe it is anxiety, maybe it is depression. But I finished undergrad in 3 years despite having to teach myself all of the information because I'm not a traditional learner, I have a full scholarship for grad school and have had a 4.0 GPA effortlessly the entire time I have been in grad school, I have a high employment outlook, I have directed a food pantry despite only being 23 at the time, youngest supervisor to be hired at my current place of employment. I do have anxiety but the issues don't stem from anxiety and anxiety feels more like a symptom of something bigger happening. I was diagnosed with major depression at the start of the pandemic but that was during a horrible time in my life where my career completely changed and I no longer feel depressed. 

 I was sent to have testing done to confirm that I have ADHD but I still feel like that does not explain why I explode. My most recent blowup was when my boyfriend said he was going to get a tattoo of a pinup girl but proceeded to show me a full-out naked woman. I ended up getting so mad that I was punching his dash so hard he was afraid I was going to set off the airbag, I kept punching my hand to avoid hitting him, I was screaming so hard it felt like my throat was bleeding, I picked my purse up and wanted to hit him with it so I ended up pouring the contents all over the car and throwing it, I picked up a waterbottle to throw at him while he was driving but I don't hit people so I ended up opening it and dumping it all over the car until he took it away, I considered grabbing the wheel and crashing the car. This entire time my boyfriend was just sitting there, crying and not even arguing with me whereas I bruised my hand so badly I was afraid I had broken it and I had done other physical damage to myself.  There is no talking me down. Sometimes I feel remorse while I am mad, but usually, I feel it immediately after I calm down. 

 That is typically how my episodes go where the other person isn't even fighting back or sometimes I won't even be mad at a person I will be mad at myself or a situation and I end up doing a kick swipe over my skin and cutting myself or I will punch myself in the legs so hard I leave bruises. I can control myself enough not to hit other people but it feels like I am going through the worst possible grief imaginable over someone just making me mildly upset or over things not going my way. 

 A major thing that sets me off is if something is not done the exact way I wanted it done. Even if someone is doing me a favor I will freak out if they do not leave the exact time I had in mind. When I was 14 I attempted suicide during one of these episodes where I just made completely impulsive decisions. 

 It seems to be worse if it is right around my period. I can go months without getting mad and then out of nowhere explode. My boyfriend said he usually can tell that I am going to snap. This last time where I freaked out over the tattoo he pointed out that; I had a horrible nightmare 3 days prior to freaking out, said I felt on edge and was extremely anxious, kept freaking out about being alone in the dark and saying I felt like something bad was going to happen, then each day I was just a little bit more snippy until the day I freaked out.",1617332824.0

I'm not sure if it's considered OCD or general anxiety or PPA (I'm 11 months post-partum now) but I feel like I have just stopped coping in life. For the past few years I get super obsessed with some type of health issue either with me or now my son. I obsessively research it, constantly check for symptoms and essentially let it consume my life. So far I've done this at pretty much every stage of pregnancy, obsessively googling miscarriages, genetic anomalies, gestational diabetes. In my son I've been obsessed with him having autism, CP, shuddering disorder, epilepsy at this list goes on. 

I'm currently in the middle of an obsessive round, this time about my teeth. I have gum recession, so much so that I have had a gum graft two years ago. The same spot is receding again and I think it is likely I will need another graft. It's partially genetic, my mother has similar issues and has terrible teeth. I have just seen my dentist and have a consultation with a periodontist in May. But I can't stop obsessing about this. It has consumed my thoughts, I've spent hours upon hours researching how bad this is going to get, the cost, the pain. I am checking my teeth in a mirror every five minutes. I can't sleep, I've been skipping meals so sugar isn't sitting on my teeth.

Ya'll I have an 11 month old baby. I should be spending this time playing with and enjoying him. I have an awesome husband who has been working full time and picking up the slack around the house because I'm barely functioning as an adult.

That first time they left me out of the group left me with pretty bad anxiety and abandoment issues and i'm really scared of ending up alone. I get anxiety attacks when i see my friends together somewhere when i wasn't invited bc that just reminds me of everything that happened.

Context over. Now i'm scared that i am actually starting to get depressed for real this time. My anxiety has never been this bad.

Something so little with next to no meaning, completely infects my brain and makes every day so hard to deal with. It started years ago, with being afraid of just my own sinks at my house, but as of now it involves any sink I may walk past or use.

After staring at it for a couple seconds to study that it is, in fact off, my brain will always shoot me intrusive thoughts. Telling me that it's still on, and is gonna end badly and all be my fault if I don't check for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc time. I have the same issue with locks and stoves, however it is nowhere near as severe as sinks. 

I hate this problem, and hate I never said anything to anyone about it. But I am so tired of it and I don't know how to make it stop.

I lost my vision and I was shaking so bad. On top of that, I felt like I was going to pass out and vomit. Is this a panic attack? My doctor did not really know either, but she is just a primary doctor so I guess she couldn't do much.  I have been getting more and more anxious and depressed recently because my life is kinda a mess right now.

So, I think I need to go get help. My doctor did tell me that the reason why I possibly have really bad stomach issues is due to stress and anxiety. I want to stop feeling like this, and I want to live without worrying so much to the point it hurts my body. 

With that, I am reaching to you all and I am asking where to go. My doctor told me to wait two weeks t see how my stomach issues are but she also said those ""attacks"" are a totally different issue. Do I go see a psychiatrist? Thearpist? Who do I see first so they can tell me what's wrong with me mentally?

Mind you I am using my parent's insurance and I live in the U.S. I also would like to add that my parents do not think I have anything wrong mentally, but I do. I kinda feel like I am crumbling hard and I can't keep holding it in anymore.

This is a community that I wish I had found a few years ago when my ex-husband committed suicide.

I'm grateful that I have found you now and hope to connect with you along the path of healing.

I wrote an article to share my story, which helped me a lot on my path to healing.

I hope it offers some solace to others who are suffering at the moment or at zig-zagging in-and-out of the various stages of grief. We, the survivors of suicide, all have a story.

We‚Äôd call after school and play games together and, eventually I went on my first date ever, and it was with him. However, this whole time I was having incredible anxiety about everything surrounding him; I was not and I am not in a place where I should be dating and I know that for a fact. It would turn into me being emotionally dependent on him, and I‚Äôve been questioning my sexuality and gender for years, it‚Äôs just so not the time for me to be dating. So at the end of our date, i made it clear that I didn‚Äôt want to date, but it was a perfect first date that I‚Äôd never forget and I loved being around him. We stayed great friends and still called after school and talked in school all the time. I still like him a ton, and I know that very recently he got a girlfriend, and I was surprised when it made me very sad. I know it‚Äôs very toxic and bad for me to not want to date, but not want him to date, but that‚Äôs not it, I promise. We haven‚Äôt called in weeks, and we rarely talk now.

I am now in my last year of PhD in physics and I am totally blocked, I don't know if I will be able to write the thesis and finish the PhD. 
I decided to study physics since I was in highschool and I now realize that I may have picked this subject because it looked like a challenge, a difficult challenge that would give me credit in the others' eyes. Why did the others' opinion on me mattered so much? I think that's because I am an introvert and I always struggled in my relationships with other people since I have a certain degree of social anxiety. Thus, my solution to be admired and well seen was to impress by something at which I was good: learning complex things and having a career in academia. This would somehow compensate my lack of social skills and would allow me to have some self confidence when interacting with people.
However, this way of functioning is not working anymore for me since I realized that I do not have the necessary skills to form meaningful relationships with other people. Since 1 or 2 years I started to open up to family and friends and the feeling of really ""knowing"" and ""discovering"" the others is sublime. 
The problem is that it seems that I cannot let go to my PhD even though I am no longer able to work on it, I am totally scared by it and all I do is to avoid thinking about it. And here comes my belief about this: I am revolting against my old way of being and instead accepting it and going on by developing other skills(like the social skills) I blame it and kind of want to remove that part of myself. Moreover, I am a perfectionist (in the bad sense of the word) and instead of doing something that is not perfect in my eyes I tend to block and to to nothing. This is the situation in which I find myself in this period.


I hope that I was sufficiently coherent with what I said. Anyway, do you have any advice concerning how I could unblock myself, stop the interior revolution and finish this fu**ing PhD?",1617313671.0

190,My OCD caused panic during masturbation.,10,mhr64k,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mhr64k/my_ocd_caused_panic_during_masturbation/,5,"Hey, guys. I'm a 23 year-old male and have been experiencing 'pure'-OCD for nearly two years now; a variant on my lifelong obsessive-compulsive disorder. Centrally, an awful theme that I've contended with is is the thought of being a pedophile, or having a sexual attraction to young children - all of which is absolutely ridiculous, and not grounded in evidence from my previous desires, etc. Now, due to the obvious sensitivity of the subject matter, and as I'm sure some of you have yourselves experienced, some people will understandably project their worst assumptions into this, as is their ignorance about this being a common theme that people with OCD - an anxiety disorder, above all else - experience.

For myself, the causality for this theme was finding out that an ex-teacher was himself a pedophile, and I irrationally myself began avoiding children on the street and other - I can now see - silly, isolating behaviour (not watching live-action TV) that of course, is the exact opposite of what an actual person who is this way inclined would do. So, on Saturday night, I debated whether or not to pleasure myself 'one final time' (as I'm in a healthy state of moving on, and have realized unsurprisingly that neither sex or masturbation is that important to me).

My somewhat quirky way of doing it since I was 13 has always been to hump the bed, and in recent years, firmly keep my eyes shut and be under the covers, so as to not be looking at anything else. So, before doing it, I had been experiencing normal, sexual thoughts about two women I'd been sexual with and another I just remembered from my past, who I was always interested in.

Then, swirling images from content I'd viewed on my laptop prior to falling asleep that aren't sexual, like movie trailers and articles, would come and go. One of them was an image of Kurt Cobain's daughter when she was an infant that was from a trailer I'd watched twice prior to falling asleep, and obviously that didn't do anything for me, they just came and went, just like images of Boris Johnson, etc. I became terrified of the former images polluting my head-space while thinking of those three women, but didn't want to not indulge in normal, healthy self-pleasure because of my OCD feeding me misinformation, and so I eventually went ahead and masturbated, thinking of them as I climaxed, then the Cobain image came immediately after and I was repulsed then the women came back, and then for the first time ever, felt the need to 're-do' my masturbation (obvious, textbook OCD). Unsurprisingly, when I didn't consciously try and regulate the order of my thoughts, the scary thought especially went away.

The climaxing images here included, randomly, Trey Parker, Seth Macfarlane, Ewan McGregor, Sophie Okonedo, etc, and that's it. I've never consciously conjured inappropriate images and pleasured myself to them. I'm also happy I continued the first time round, after the fifth image ended up being of Cobain because I shook my head to almost say, 'go away' and the image of the women returned; I knew what my intention was, and propranolol definitely has helped put this into clarity.

All in all, I ended up 'redoing' it a further eight times, and actually feel a lot better after remembering my older brother's helpful phrase, ''intention is everything'', which has been the best rhetorical silver-bullet for this variant of OCD, as it hammers home how there's nothing to feel the slightest bit guilty about. That said, what'd you guys think?",1617296095.0

From 14-16 I‚Äôve been put on many different SSRIs and antipsychotics which had been unprescribed because of related side effects. 

Now, I‚Äôm 18 and have been taking sertraline for a year and a half which helped with my social anxiety and it was smooth sailing (most of my psychotic symptoms were still there but far more manageable) 

The past 4 months I felt the symptoms becoming more like they were prior to my treatment and I told my psychiatrist two days ago. He suggested I start abilify. 

My issue stems from the fact that when I was on olanzapine I gained weight which directly affected my self esteem which was already low prior to the weight gain. 

I‚Äôve seen a lot of mixed reviews and I‚Äôm not sure what to do and I felt like asking more people might be the right thing to do before I make a decision.

198,"I akways feel ""high"" after a depressive episode",5,mhs9ks,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mhs9ks/i_akways_feel_high_after_a_depressive_episode/,3,"I get pretty down and despondent with depressive episodes, very little energy to do things and life in general feels grey and empty.

When I start to get better, I usually get better very quickly. I generally have a day where I'm middling, flat mood but generally more energy, and then the next day I feel fantastic and become very productive. I don't do anything particularly wild or anything but I get all my chores done, can work late into the evening (university student), everything is suddenly extremely interesting and exciting again. My mind races and I read books and start different projects etc. I get this feeling in my chest that I can only describe as euphoric and I feel ""high"".

When I feel like this, and think back to how I felt during the very recent depressive period, I don't understand how I could have behaved like that. Getting better seems so simple, and I could just continue to go on like this forever and I'd be fine. This usually lasts a few days to a week, then I generally slow down and might crash again, or just be fine but a with a flat mood, doing less.

Just wanted to know if this is normal and does anyone else experience this when coming out of a depressive episode?

I've recently started getting help for my mental health and have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder.

Sorry if this isn't very clear, I find it hard to describe. Thanks in advance for any replies.",1617301161.0

Why?,1,mi3p0s,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mi3p0s/i_feel_like_my_personality_is_splitting_in_two/,2,"Since I was a child I had always been internally lunatic, but my personality was stable and sometimes I would express my anger in a very explosive manner after keeping my feelings inside for too long. But now I am 19 and I feel like I have an alter ego literally. I went from seeing myself as a whole with its contradictions like everyone, with good and bad inside. Now I feel like I‚Äôm split, like there is two me that want different things and with totally different personalities. Only started having an alter-ego this year but I don‚Äôt understand, as it can‚Äôt be DPD because it gets triggered in childhood and I didn‚Äôt have that in childhood, only now.",1617336139.0
